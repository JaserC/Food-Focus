# Need

An existing app that addresses a similar need as our mission is Lose It: https://www.loseit.com/snapit/. Lose It allows the user to snap an image of a food, which then shows a specific nutritional information based on serving sizes. However, this app could be improved by allowing users to search up existing food or meals. This would be easier instead of taking a picture of an actual food in order to know about the nutrition details of the food. By having a way to search up meals and having a list of existing food, this allows the users to know more about the food they're eating. Furthermore, the app doesn't provide information about the nutrition benefits when eating a specific food. It would better if they could show more details the vitamins and areas that improve a person's physical health. Moreover, the app doesn't provide recipes to make a specific meal or provide nearby locations on where to get these meals.
