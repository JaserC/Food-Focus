## Usability 
Based on our SUS Testing results, many of our participants overall would use Food Focus but not as a frequent user. They find that the features in the app are well integreated and easy to use. The learnabilty score of our app has an high average, which shows that it's effiecent to learn and quickly to know how use Food Focus. It doesn't takes a lot of effort for our users to understand how our app works. 

## Utility
Based on the results, we see that our participants don't particularly likes or dislikes the app, which we think it's because they don't normally tracks the food they consume daily. However, we find that our app feature that shows nutritional information is helpful for people who tracks their amount of calories and other nutritions intakes. The History screen is helpful, where it saves meals that the user likes and also provides nearby locations on where to purchase these meals.
