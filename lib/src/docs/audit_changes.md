# Audit Changes

Describe any changes you made to your app in response to the audit, or any changes you decided to not make (e.g. if you disagree with an audit recommendation).

The audit was mostly positive about the user experience, but there were significant issues raised. There were no accessibiilty concerns raised in relation to the contrast, so we maintained our current color scheme. There were 2 significant concerns raised: the accessibility reader compatability and the structure of some views. 

When it came to the accessibility concern, we went back through the app and added semantic labeling to every element on every page that required it. This was specifically important for the images we used throughout the application. At this point, the accessibility reader compatability is robust and we are confident in our usability for marginalized individuals with this need. 

When it came to view structure, we made some edits, but not all. One of the changes we made was with the history screen. The complaint was that element did not have enough spacing, which is obviously a valid concern. However, we designed the app for minimal distance between elements because we wanted minimal hand movement across the screen in accordance to Fitt's Law. What the advice did was make us think about increasing space without "increasing space". This led us to completely change the orientation of the display such that we did not display elements in a grid anymore, but rather in a list view. This allowed us to increase the tap targets for a specific entry, maximize horizontal space, and still have elements grouped together. We did not take the advice when it came to the home page because it required tradeoffs we did. Altering the text would require changing the horizontal spacing between tiles, which was not acceptable to us, or we could extend the text into two rows if it got too long. What this does is add inconsistency to the size of a slider row, which is why we could not find a way to acceptably take the advice. We reviewed the app on different platforms and determined that the text was close, but it did not overlap and our testing revealed that users could still distinguish between foods.
