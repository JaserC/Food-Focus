What the app does well: This app is very good in its robustness. For example, when using the bar on the bottom, it changes screens when clicked. Additionally, when adding a meal, it populates onto the history correctly, and records the date and time and location added. It also meets contrast guidelines, and uses bolded font which makes it easy to read. Overall, it is very robust, visually accessible and functions as intended. 

What the app does poorly and how it can be improved: 

One thing that could be improved is the spacing between the meals. For example, the text between the lemon herb chicken and smoked salmon salad are super close to each other and look like one line. I think this could cause some confusion. Other than that, the app works great.

## Accessibility Issue

Name/Brief Description - Semantics arenâ€™t available for images

Testing Method - MacOs Screen Accessibility Reader

Evidence - WCAG Non-Text Content (1.1.1)

Explanation - The problem occurs based on WCAG Guideline 1.1.1 Non-Text Content, which says that alternative text must be available for non-text content, including images to help the user understand the meaning of them. When using the screen reader, alternative text is not available for the images of the foods. As a result of this, this may cause confusion for individuals, for example those who have a vision impairment, who rely on the screen reader to understand what is being shown. As a result, this may make it difficult for the user to use the app as intended. 
Severity Rating - 4
Justification - The problem is common, as it occurs for every type of food. Therefore, the frequency is considered high. As the images function as an important part of the app, the persistence is high, and therefore a solution should be found. 
Possible Solution -  A potential solution for this is simple. Adding semantics that describe the images can assist the user in understanding what the image is displaying.
